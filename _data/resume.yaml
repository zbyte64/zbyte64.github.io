  summary: 'I am a wonky person when it comes to improving software development. Because I have been continuously learning for 18 years, I will bring a diverse set of tools that I hope will catch on like fire: Toyota Kata, Wardley Mapping, Event Storming, Non-Violent Communication, and more! These are tools that get to the core of what I believe is the ultimate challenge in software development: intentional communication. My philosophy is that development is a process of continuously setting expectations, often in response to unexpected outcomes. To succeed, we must not only provide psychological safety to encourage dissenting viewpoints, but also give others to tools and setting to explore those questions and ideas.'

      While LinkedIn only allows you to select one position for a recommendation, I've worked with Jason at three different companies – Cuker, Edit, and Shift3/Bitwise – and interacted with him in many tech community settings over the last 15 years.

      I have always found Jason to be an exceptional, thoughtful software developer. He cares greatly about the quality of his code while still being able to ship on time. He is the first person I think of when I hear the term "software craftsmanship".

      Jason has always shown himself to be both eager to learn and happy to share his knowledge. I have learned much from him over the years, and I am a better developer for having worked with him. Any team he is on will benefit from his presence, and his teammates will be better software engineers as a result.
