Howdy,

If you're hear wondering what it would be like to work with me, there are a few things you shold know:

First, it is hard for me to perceive my autism as a disability, to me it is a constraint the empowers when worked with instead of against.
Second, this autistic experience informs my empathy for others beyond what I am able to understand in the moment. This means I let dissenting opinions change me, even though I might resist at first. Given the space, I can use that friction to grow past a challenge.
I am passionate about more than technology. To me all value is social and this leads me to believe the critical factors behind the success of a project has less to do with the technologies chosen, but more to do with how humans choose to collaborate and whether they are using the technologies appropriately.
